# Plant_Disease_Detection

This repository includes classification of plant Diseases into 15 classes with good amount of accuracy.
Model uses Keras and convolutional layers for the classification with binary_crossentropy loss function,
it provides good accuracy on the classification model. File utils.py contains functions which are to be 
used by model.py, this provides a glimpse of this repository. A plant_disease_detection.ipynb file is also 
included in this repository to give a glance of how the different code file works together.
